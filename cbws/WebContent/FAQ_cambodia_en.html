	What is PEx?
	<ul><li><span>
    PEx is short for Payment Express, a revolutionary new mobile-to-mobile money transfer service. PEx enables you to pay from your Hong Leong Current or Savings account to any local mobile number on your smart phone contacts address book or to anyone with a local mobile number. Payee is required to collect the PEx payment via Internet to transfer the fund into his/her HLBVN account.</span></li></ul></li></ul></td></tr>
    
	<tr><td style=background-color:#b8b8b8><center>Q2.</center></td><td><ul id="expList"><li>How can the person receive the PEx payment from me?<ul><li><span>
    The payee will first receive an SMS from Hong Leong Bank to notify them of the PEx payment performed by you. The notification SMS contains the payment amount and advise him/her to contact sender for payment collection within 3 days of the transaction date. The payee would need to contact you for the Collection Code before they can collect the PEx payment successfully. It is your responsibility to verify the payee and to disclose the Collection Code to the payee only and not to anybody else.</span></li></ul></li></ul></td></tr>
